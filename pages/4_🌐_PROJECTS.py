                ### Conclusion
                In this endeavor, we created an extensive system to estimate the calories and weight of food items
                    from images and videos. Utilizing the advanced features of the YOLO V8 model for object detection
                    and classification, we precisely identified and localized food items within the images. The fine-tuned
                    YOLO V8 model, trained on a varied dataset encompassing 15 different food categories, showed strong
                    performance in the classification of food items.
                    The detected food items‚Äô subsequent weight estimation was carried out using a K-Nearest Neighbors
                    (KNN) model. This model predicted the weight based on the area of the food items, generating precise
                    weight estimates that were subsequently used to compute the total calorie content. The combination
                    of these models allowed us to obtain dependable and accurate assessments of food calorie and weight,
                    fulfilling an essential requirement in dietary evaluation and nutrition management.
                    The findings of this project highlight the value of integrating advanced machine learning models with
                    well-organized datasets to tackle intricate real-world challenges. Future research could investigate broad-
                    ening the range of food categories, enhancing model precision, and incorporating real-time processing
                    functionalities to improve the system‚Äôs usability and relevance. In sum, this project marks a critical
                    advancement towards automated dietary assessment tools that can help foster healthier eating behaviors
                    and greater nutritional awareness. """)
